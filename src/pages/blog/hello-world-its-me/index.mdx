Hey there, Toby here. I finally finished creating my blog! But who am I? And what type of posts are coming in the next couple of weeks?

In this article I want to introduce myself as a person and developer.

<!--more-->

### TL:DR

I learned many things in the past years, but I want to adopt to the new technologies out there. Therefor I want to write about security and best-
practices in API design in my future posts, especially with Spring Boot and NextJS/NuxtJS.

## Who am I?

At the moment, just a stranger off the internet, I guess. But let's be serious. My name is Toby, and I am a computer science student living in Hamburg,
Germany. I've always loved to write, worked on the school newspaper back in the days and kept writing down thoughts, ideas and other helpful information.

When entering university, I already knew a lot of mechanisms, algorithms and frameworks. Because the lectures weren't challenging, nor interesting, I
started reading blog posts regarding newest tech-stacks, mechanisms and approaches. I wanted to expand my horizon. So I started side projects. A lot of
side projects. I am 20 now, and my side project graveyard is growing drastically.

In the following sections I want to take you on my journey of learning how to code and maybe wake up memories or even motivate you to try it on your own.

## Java

I made my first experiences with programming back in 2013 whilst playing the online game [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net). I played on a single server
every day after school with my friends. In school, we agreed on what time we will be online, to play together and build up our base (haven't had a smartphone
back then). But that server went offline as many others in the coming years. Shortly after minigames became popular. Playing hunger games in Minecraft
was a big deal. But to play those specific gamemodes you'd have to mod the game. That was possible using plugins.

I started reading through Minecraft Plugin development and stumbled over [Craftbukkit](https://getbukkit.org/) and [Java](https://www.java.com).
Craftbukkit is a popular server library with an easy to use API. Minecraft was developed in Java, so the plugins are simple Java modules following a
strictly defined schema. I read the book [Java ist auch eine Insel](http://openbook.rheinwerk-verlag.de/javainsel/) (translates to "Java is an island too")
and started working on my own minigames.

I met a couple of Java devs at this time, worked with small dev teams on bigger servers and actually made some money doing this. It was a great time.
But I wanted to improve. So I came across Webapps. At that time, Javascript and Node weren't as popular as today, so I started learning php.

## PHP

Next up I started learning [PHP](https://www.php.net). It was different coming from a strictly typed high level language as Java to the runtime dynamic PHP. But it worked out
just fine, and I started creating webapps using frameworks like [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [Slim](http://www.slimframework.com/). Once I was pretty comfortable working with Laravel and PHP, I wanted
to create my own framework. So I read into the lifecycle of applications and how the requests are processed. After that I started writing my own router.
Though there were many router implementations available, I wanted to do it on my own. Not for use in production, but to understand the technology behind it.
I think this is as important as writing clean and readable code.

That was one of the first times I encountered databases. I worked with them in the past,
but now its about Models and relationships instead of simple SQL queries.

## Spring Boot

Till this day I use and love [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/). It is super easy to use and understand. Is pretty powerfull and scaleable. Easy to
containerize and deploy. Java is a powerfull language and strictly typed, so that there's no need of configuring the project to get types like with
NodeJS and TypeScript.

The Spring Boot framework has a vast community all over the world and dozens of libraries are available. It offers you authentication out of the box
and keeps your code simple and clean. Testing with JUnit and AssertJ makes it even better.

That's why I'm building the site [learn-spring.com](learn-spring.com)
which will be a course platform of video tutorials for learning Spring Boot from scratch. It's not available at the moment, but I'll let you know when
it launches.

I played with other frameworks aswell. I liked using NodeJS with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
But none of them reached the efficiency I can achieve with Spring Boot.

## Frontend frameworks

Pretty late I discovered the true power of frontend frameworks like [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) or [React](https://reactjs.org/). Though I never really used
them as standalone SPA's (Single Page Applications). I fell in love with [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/) which is powered by view and the React powered
[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). This blog is using NextJS and Markdown to provide this article btw.

I started using Bootstrap and jQuery and had no idea how much pain I hab over the years. Building frontends should be easy. I also started using
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as my CSS framework of choice. It is super easy to configure and you can use it intuitively. I love the utility-first
approach the guys over at Tailwind follow and adopted it for my own work.

## Summary

I came a long way in a short period, and I am not close to an end. There is still so much to discover and learn, as there are new frameworks and improved runtimes
released now and then. Shortly we got [Deno](https://deno.land/), a more secure alternative to NodeJS, made by the same guy how actually made Node.

Security plays an important role in our modern society. We all want our data to be safe. All we as developers can do, is to follow the best-practices
that have been developed, and think about new ones. Never use something, because "xy uses it". Understand your technology. Know what you are doing
and why.

That's it for me for today, hope you liked the read and see you in the next post.

Cheers,
Toby
